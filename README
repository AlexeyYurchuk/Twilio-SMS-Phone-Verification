Here lies the code to verify a phone number using the Twilio API and SMS.

User inputs phone number by accessing form.php.

form.php contacts sendcode.php that sends a verification code to the user's phone using the twilio API.

User inputs that verification code, and verify.php checks to see if the code is valid.

The code provided needed to be edited to include your database configuration (see sendcode.php and verify.php). Moreover, you will need to edit the $user_id referenced in verify.php to specify the ID of the logged in user.
